## Summary

After many years working with computer support, I'm finally fulfilling my dream to be a mobile developer. With 3 years of freelance experience, I overcame several challenges and was able to deliver high quality apps. I love to learn, use and talk about new technologies and I don't feel satisfied until I make the perfect algorithm. Besides that, I enjoy learning new languages (both human and computer), play games and watch movies and TV shows.
