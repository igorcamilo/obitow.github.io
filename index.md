# Igor Camilo

## Summary

After seven years working with computer support, I'm looking for new challenges as a software developer. In my 3 years of freelance experience, I was able to deliver high quality native iOS apps. I'm self motivated, fast learner, adaptable and passionate about technology. On my free time, I enjoy learning new languages (both human and computer) and play games.
